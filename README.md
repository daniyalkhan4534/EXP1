int intergers are basically whole numbers that lack decimal values and can have positive, negative, and zero values.

float and double float and double are used to hold real numbers.  Float (a single precision float data type) has a capacity of 4 bytes. Additionally, double is an 8-byte data type that uses double precision.

char Variables of the character type are declared using the keyword char. The character variable is 1 byte in size.

In C, the format specifiers are utilised for both input and output. When collecting input using the scanf() function and publishing using the printf() method, the compiler can determine the type of data in a variable by applying this idea.
